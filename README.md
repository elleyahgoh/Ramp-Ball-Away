# Ramp-Ball-Away
A simple obstacle-dodging ball game, created to help me further understand the fundamentals of Unity. It is an Android game, featuring on-screen features to make the ball move left and right and jump.

The arrow keys on-screen are used to move the ball left or right. The middle button makes the ball jump.
Obstacles in the game are meant to be dodged. Colliding with an obstacle results in a game over.
Highscores are recorded through recording the longest game time played by the player.
